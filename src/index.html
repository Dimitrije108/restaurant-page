        <h1>KAFANA</h1>
        <p>Kafana is a distinct type of local bistro (or tavern), common in former Yugoslav countries, which primarily serves
            alcoholic beverages and coffee, and often also light snacks (meze) and other food. Many kafanas feature live music performances. <br>
            <br>
            The concept of a social gathering place for men to drink alcoholic beverages and coffee originated in the Ottoman Empire and
            spread to Southeast Europe during Ottoman rule, further evolving into the contemporary kafana.</p>
